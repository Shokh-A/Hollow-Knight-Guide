                        <p>Bosses are unique enemies in Hollow Knight with typically higher health or deal more damage than the standard creatures in the same area. The Knight may have to defeat a Boss to access a new area, acquire an item, complete a quest, or simply further the main story of the game. When the Knight encounters a Boss, their name will usually appear on-screen, and the music will change into a battle theme. There is a total of 47 bosses in the game.</p>

It trapped the Grubs from the Forgotten Crossroads colony and recorded their location throughout Hallownest on a map. Despite its attention to the Grubs, it only has three within its tower.

As such, he participated in many battles and adventures. He was also equally renowned for his bad scent, although that did not keep him from enjoying the company of the White Lady and his fellow knights. He was particularly fond of the knight Isma. Ogrim survived the Infection but isolated himself in a part of the Royal Waterways where refuse gathers. There, as the Dung Defender, he guards the pump control that allows entry to Isma's Grove on the other side of the sewers. The Dung Defender defies any who would enter the place to challenge him. He also passes time by rolling dung around and moulding statues out of it. The Dung Defender seems unaware of the fate of his king and the other knights.

They managed to resist the Infection throughout Hallownest despite the exile of their brother and his followers, who chose to accept the Infection willingly. The Mantis Lords have kept the beasts of Deepnest confined to their territory, killing those who would intrude upon the village. This duty was part of a truce with the Kingdom, maintained even as it fell to ruins. Yet the Mantis Lords, like the rest of their Tribe, remain proud warriors.

He refused to listen to the Pale King opposing his work, and failed to realise that his own infected mind was influencing him. Soul Master hoarded Soul and consumed it, eventually gaining new Soul powers. He had Soul Totems gathered in the Sanctum and drained many unfortunate bugs of their vital energy. Unlike the rest of the Kingdom's inhabitants, he and his followers were able to survive the Infection. However, he was driven to obsession in his quest for immortality, and lost his sanity while trying to get closer to the light that was guiding him in his mind.</td>

Defeating a Warrior Dream rewards a large amount of Essence. After acquiring the Dream Nail, the Knight may purchase the Warrior's Grave Pin from Iselda for 180, which reveals the location of the Warrior Dream in the area after that area's Map has been purchased. Dream Nailing a Warrior Dream will automatically enter the fight, and Dream Nailing them after winning the fight will automatically collect the essence without dialogue.

The spirit of Galien appears above his husk after the Knight acquires the Dream Nail. He greets them as a fellow warrior and proposes a battle to test their respective strengths. After his defeat, Galien is humbled and believes the Knight to have been sent by the Pale King to test him. He still hopes the Knight will get him in the King's good graces.

Markoth's spirit appears above his corpse after acquiring the Dream Nail. He sees the Knight as yet another meddling warrior and dares them to draw their Nail. Only after his first (and supposedly only) defeat, does Markoth notice the presence of his own corpse beside him, long forgotten. He claims that nothing ever had hold over him until the Knight.

No Eyes' spirit only appears at her statue after the Knight acquires the Dream Nail and has bought the Lumafly Lantern. While still blind, the spirit is disturbed by the light. She senses the Knight, but fears they are Infected and out to hurt her. When challenged, No Eyes agitates the sanctuary's spirits to attack her threat. After the fight, the spirits calm down while No Eyes realises the Knight never meant her harm.
