                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p>
                    <span><a href="characters.html#knight" target="_blank">The Knight</a></span> can explore the large interconnected world of Hallownest using a variety of movement and
                    combat techniques. In classic Metroidvania style, there are areas of the world that the Knight
                    cannot access until they obtain particular Items or Abilities. Maps for each area must be bought
                    from a shopkeeper generally hidden somewhere in that area, and the Knight can also buy upgrades that
                    place markers on the map or allow them to reveal parts of the map as they explore. Many areas have a
                    <span><a href="bosses.html#enemies" target="_blank">'boss'</a></span> enemy that the Knight must defeat in order to continue, and have a number of sub-bosses that
                    drop useful rewards or upgrades.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Defeated enemies drop Geo, a currency that the Knight can use to buy items from shopkeepers. If the
                    <span><a href="characters.html#knight" target="_blank">The Knight</a></span> is killed, they respawn at the last place they rested and lose all their Geo. They must then
                    return to their place of death and defeat their Shade in order to recover the currency. The Knight
                    also gains SOUL by attacking enemies, which they can then spend to recover lost health or activate
                    special abilities. Health can also be recovered at Hot Springs, which are located around the world,
                    or by resting at a Bench.
