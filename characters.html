                    <p>After climbing out of their birthplace in the Abyss, the Knight witnessed their sibling, the Hollow Knight, being taken out of the Abyss by the Pale King. The entrance to the Abyss was sealed, causing the Knight to fall back down. Sometime after this, despite the entrance being sealed, the Knight and some of their siblings managed to escape the Abyss. Eventually, the Knight ended up wandering outside of Hallownest for unknown reasons. Spending time in this area caused the Knight to lose their memories, but being there did give them a certain resilience. They returned to Hallownest after a call went out from either the Radiance or the Hollow Knight.</p>

Despite her tall stature, the two took residence in a small house next to the town's Stag Station from which she operates their shop. She wishes Cornifer would spend more time at home and worries about his health and safety. She has always declined to join her husband on his adventures beyond the Forgotten Crossroads. She doesn't find much interest in shopkeeping, yet takes great care in crafting cartography pins while taking into account her customers' needs.</td>

Eventually, Sly abandoned his occupation as Nailsage. He became convinced of the strength of accumulating Geo over honing one's nail. He thus turned to the simple life of a merchant, finding and selling wares from his shop in Dirtmouth. He did not, however, forget his mastery and respect of the nail and those who practice its arts. He keeps his greatnail in the basement of his shop and still remembers his pupils. At some point, a dream led him to wander off into the caverns below Dirtmouth. He also lost his Shopkeeper's Key which ended up in a room in Crystal Peak.</td>

Alternatively, she can be reached by crossing the Blue Lake in the Resting Grounds. Salubra sells Charms and Notches but also shares tips on their use.

During the kingdom's heyday, stags were used to transport bugs and goods across the land through the Stagways. When Hallownest fell, travels died down and most of the Stag Stations were closed. Even though his own kind disappeared and old age starts impairing him, the Last Stag remains faithful to his duties. He transports any bug calling him with the bell of a Station, wherever they are. However, his memory has been lacking and he forgot where the Stations are located on the Stagways, even the Stag Nest. Yet, the Last Stag keeps a good memory of the places he once visited and still remembers much of Hallownest's golden age. His dedication to the Stagways makes him dislike the Tramways the Pale King was building before the latter's disappearance. He also makes no difference between his riders, despite his own feelings about them.</td>

The Nailsmith is one of the few bugs that lived through the fall of Hallownest. Driven by his craft and working in seclusion, he barely noticed the world changing around him. Even before that, he hardly paid attention to the Kingdom's Five Great Knights. He spends his time honing his craft, hoping to forge one day a Pure Nail, the apex of his work.

While he remains a simple observer, he is wise of the land's dangers and has some skill with a nail. Before the fall of Hallownest, Quirrel used to be Monomon’s apprentice. When Monomon became a Dreamer, she entrusted Quirrel with her mask, which was part of an additional protection enacted upon herself. Quirrel can be seen wearing this mask on top of his head. In the official comic, it is shown that Quirrel ended up outside of Hallownest, causing him to lose much of his memory. He was called back to Hallownest by Monomon in order to reverse the protection placed on her. After entering the Howling Cliffs, Quirrel meets Hornet, whom he briefly fights. Hornet allows Quirrel to enter Hallownest when she recognizes Monomon’s mask. Quirrel can initially be found at the Temple of the Black Egg, but he can be encountered in several locations around Hallownest. After helping the Knight kill Monomon by removing the protection on her, he goes to the Blue Lake to see the source of the rain in the City of Tears.</td>

She wields a needle and thread with deadly prowess. As a boss, Hornet appears in two forms, Hornet Protector in Greenpath and Hornet Sentinel in Kingdom's Edge, which both have to be beaten to unlock her Hunter's Journal entry, or she can be defeated twice in Godmaster Godhome. Hornet is the daughter of the Pale King and Herrah the Beast, the queen of Deepnest. Her birth was the result of a bargain for her mother to become a Dreamer, and as such, she spent only a short time with Herrah. Her shared father with the Knight and the rest of the Vessels makes them siblings. Raised in Deepnest, Hornet survived the Infection and the fall of the kingdom. She wanders its ruins, chasing off travellers who would seek to desecrate them, but also protecting the sealing of the Black Egg. She also guards the Cast-Off Shell in the Kingdom's Edge which can grant the King's Brand, the key to the Abyss. In her duties, she encountered Quirrel in the Howling Cliffs at his arrival in Hallownest. She attempted to fight him but was repelled by the mask of Monomon he wears on his head. Hornet leaves him be after recognizing the mask, knowing that he was called upon, despite him not knowing it. Like Quirrel and the Knight, she sensed the awakening of the Infection and started wandering Hallownest in search of answers. In Hollow Knight, she works to stop the impending doom looming on Hallownest. In Hollow Knight: Silksong, she ends up captured and brought to the haunted kingdom of Pharloom.</td>

Unfortunately, because it is made of shellwood, it cannot deal damage.

Grubs are harmless creatures who have a good sense of direction and are highly skilled tunnelers. They are known to collect shiny things in their burrows, such as Geo and Relics. Due to mysterious reasons, all of the Grubfather's children disappeared. The Grubs can be found trapped in jars in various locations throughout Hallownest, locked there by the Collector.[</td>

Willoh is a giraffe weevil who found a unique fungus growing in Queen's Station. Since she is wary of the dangers of the Fungal Wastes and Fog Canyon, she wants to stay in Queen's Station for as long as her food lasts. Besides the fungus in the station, Willoh has eaten various bugs and thinks about eating the Knight as well. Willoh met Cloth at some point, warning her about the Mantis Tribe in Mantis Village.</td>

The voice of the Radiance appears in her mind, commanding her to kill the Knight. In the end, the Infection overtakes her, making her become hostile.
